        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Geospatial Science at RMIT University.</p>

            <p>My knack for networking, effective communication, and building relationships allows me to connect with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Whether it's collaborating with fellow geospatial enthusiasts or any professional connections, I'm energized by the power of people. On top of that, my eye for design and passion for cartography have fueled my love for visual storytelling and map creation!</p>
            
           <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I serve as the Vice President of the Geospatial Science Student Association (GSSA) at RMIT. This leadership role has allowed me to foster a vibrant community, encouraging knowledge exchange and collaboration among geospatial enthusiasts.</p>
            
            <p>Besides that, I have a deep interest and appreciation for different cultures and languages. It started with learning French at school and I’m currently learning Japanese. I’m fluent in English and Tamil, which is my mother tongue. I love travelling and I’m hoping to find an opportunity where I can travel and work while experiencing new cultures and traditions and getting the chance to network with a wide range of people.</p>
